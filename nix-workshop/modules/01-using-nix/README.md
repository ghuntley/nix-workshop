# Using Nix

## Overview

This section will provide a run-through of how to perform common task using the
suite of programs collectively known as the "Nix package manager", as well as some
third-party utilities.

If you have done the NixOS workshop, you will have already used some of these
programs, like `nix-env` and `nix-channel`, to perform truly essential tasks.
We'l put these tasks at the beginning, in a "recap" section.

Then we'll focus on several activities, and how to perform them, rather than
focus on the tools themselves. The executables come with very good manpages and
`--help` sections, and the [Nix Manual] contains a more detailed reference.

This module doesn't contain any NixOS-specific commands, and can be worked
through on a regular user account, either on NixOS or on any other Nix-enabled
OS.
