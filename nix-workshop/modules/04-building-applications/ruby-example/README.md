# Overview

We'll "nixify" a Ruby application; more specifically, a jekyll-based website.
More specifically yet, we'll nixify the Compose :: Conference website.

This exercise can be done under NixOS or, if you have installed Nix on your
Linux or MacOS laptop, you can try it there.

## Type this

Start by cloning the conference site and checking out the appropriate branch:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/candeira/composeconference.git
$ cd composeconference
$ git checkout 2019-melbourne-nix-workshop
```

At this point you may want to take a look around before proceeding. 

The composeconference.org site is just a jekyll site on the gh-pages branch of a
git repo. Its `Gemfile` is simple enough:

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'json', '>=1.8.5'
gem 'github-pages'
gem 'jekyll-redirect-from'
```

Let's create a temporary shell containing our bundix and ruby-devEnv
dependencies, use `bundle lock` to generate a `Gemfile.lock` file, and then use
bundix to generate the `gemset.nix` file to convert the ruby-universe
dependencies into nixpkgs dependencies:

```
$ nix-shell -p ruby.devEnv bundix
(...)
[nix-shell]$ bundle lock
(...)
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
Resolving dependencies....
Writing lockfile to /home/kandinski/data/work/hack/composeconference/Gemfile.lock
[nix-shell]$ bundix Gemfile.lock
[nix-shell]$ exit
```
We now have all we need to install and run jekyll under Nix.

Open a file called `default.nix` and write this in it:

```
with import <nixpkgs> { };                                                  # 1

let jekyll_env = bundlerEnv {                                               # 2
    name = "jekyll_env";
    ruby = ruby_2_5;
    gemfile = ./Gemfile;
    lockfile = ./Gemfile.lock;
    gemset = ./gemset.nix;
  };
in 
  stdenv.mkDerivation {                                                     # 3
    name= "jekyll_env";
    buildInputs = [ jekyll_env ];                                           # 4

    shellHook = ''
      exec ${jekyll_env}/bin/jekyll serve --incremental --watch             # 5 
    '';
  }
```

Let's see what this does:

  1. The opening `with import <nixpkgs> { };` ensures you don't have to write
     `pkgs.bundlerEnv`, `pkgs.ruby_2_5` etc. everywhere.
  1. `bundlerEnv` is a Nix built-in function for creating Bundler environments.
  1. `stdenv.mkDerivation` is the way most packages are set up in Nix.
  1. We have `buildInputs` because that's what jekyll is: the development
     dependency to our website, which is the product.
  1. The `shellHook` will be ran when you enter a shell with `nix-shell`.
     Because `exec` replaces the bash shell that nix-shell was going to start
     with a jekyll process, once you close jekyll with `C-c` the environment
     will be closed as well.

Now we can start the shell. The first time we'll have to wait a bit while it
downloads and configures dependencies. The second time and ongoing, it will be
faster:

```
$ nix-shell
( ... lots of errors, this is a bit embarrassing ... )
                    done in 1.417 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/home/kandinski/data/work/hack/composeconference'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.

```

You can now edit the site and the dev server will restart each time you save, just as you expect.
