# Introduction to Nix

## üìñ Overview

This workshop provides a view of Nix, the purely functional package manager, and
the Nix expression language, which is used to define packages for Nix.

Nix can be used as a package manager on non-NixOS GNU/Linux distributions as
well as on MacOS, so this section of the tutorial is useful even if you don't
plan to run NixOS full time. If you' re using a GNU/Linux distro, Nix can be
used to install new software (or new versions** alongside system-installed
packages. If you're on MacOS, Nix can be a replacement/supplement for MacPorts
or Homebrew.

By the end of this module you will:

* Learn what the Nix package manager is, and how it improves the status quo
  over other forms of Unix packages.
* Be able to write simple Nix expressions to describe, build and install
  packages in several language platforms.

## ‚úã Before You Begin

You need to have the Nix package manager installed on your computer before
proceeding. Per-platform installation instructions can be found in the [previous
module][previous-module].

## üí° What is the Nix package manager

Every package has a hash based on everything that was used to build it, and the
package outputs are placed in an immutable store that is keyed on that hash.

The [About Nix] chapter of the Nix manual provides a more detailed overview of the
benefits of Nix. In summary, we get these benefits:

* we have atomic upgrades and rollbacks
* we can have multiple versions of packages installed
* multiple non-privileged users installing packages without issue
* we have a simple functional language that can be used to describe these
  packages
* our package descriptions always have a complete description of their
  dependencies
* we can share a cache of build artifacts and know that we‚Äôre getting the same
  outputs as if we‚Äôd built everything from the source code ourselves

That idea can be extended to managing a whole Linux distribution (NixOS) a fleet
of machines (NixOps), but here we're looking at the package manager.

## üí° What is the Nix expression language

The Nix expression language is a pure, lazy, functional language.

- Purity means that operations in the language don't have side-effects (for instance, there is no variable assignment). The only side effects are deliberate and controlled, and aimed at its main function of building software packages.
- Laziness means that arguments to functions are evaluated only when they are needed. 
- Functional means that functions are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù values that can be passed around and manipulated in interesting ways.

The language is not a full-featured, general purpose language. Its main job is to describe packages, compositions of packages, and the variability within packages.

In [the next module][next-module] you'll learn about using Nix as a package manager. First
we'll recap some of the tasks you've already performed, then we'll dive into
more tasks.
