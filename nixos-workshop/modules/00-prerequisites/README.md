# Prerequisites

## 📖 Overview

If you are doing this workshop as part of a classroom, it is important to
pre-install these components before attendance as you'll need to download
upwards of 4Gb of software from the internet.

## ☑️ Software Installation

Attendees will need a computer with Virtual Box installed:

* [ ] Download the [NixOS demo appliance][download-nixos-ova] for VirtualBox (in
      OVA format) that has X11 and Plasma 5 enabled.
* [ ] Download the [NixOS graphical installation ISO][download-nixos-iso] which
      contains the NixOS installer.
* [ ] Download and install [VirtualBox][download-virtualbox].
* [ ] Download and install [VirtualBox Extension Pack][download-virtualbox-extension-pack].

## ☑️ Configuration

If you are installing NixOS on a laptop as it's primary operating system then
you'll need to [burn the installation ISO to a USB drive or DVD][burn-the-iso].

Alternatively, if you are going to use VirtualBox then you'll need to:

* [ ] In VirtualBox, use the menu option `File -> Import Appliance` and import
      the [NixOS demo appliance][download-nixos-ova].

Then, still within VirtualBox and with the appliance turned off, go into the
   virtual machine settings and change the following details:

* [ ] **System/Motherboard**: Raise memory to 4GB or 8GB, or some
      `nixos-rebuild` or `nix-env` operations might fail.
* [ ] **Network/Adapter2**: Ensure you have your host laptop's WiFi card as
      `Attached to: Bridged Adapter`
* [ ] **USB**: Disable USB 2.0 and enable 1.1 instead.

Windows users, if Hyper-V is enabled on your computer [you'll need to follow
these steps][bcd-edit] from Scott Hanselman before VirtualBox will work on your
computer.

## What's next

🎉 that's it. You're now ready to learn all about the NixOS operating system. In
